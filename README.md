(WIP- this isn't done yet. Hooks are hard)

## act.js

_A React.js clone with a subset of the full API written in >500 lines of code_

## Included Methods

This contains only the minimal number of methods I thought fit for a "Minimum Viable"
version of React. Included methods are:

* `render`
* `createElement`
* `useState`
* `useEffect`
* `useContext`

## API differences

- There is no synthetic system. Do not needlessly camel case DOM methods. `onclick` is `onclick`
