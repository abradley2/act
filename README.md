_A React.js clone with a subset of the full API written in >500 lines of code_

This was a fun experiment to see how small I can make a mini react-clone
with only the methods in React that I actually like,

It contains only a stand-in for `render`, `createElement`,
`useContext`, `useReducer`, and
`useEffect` with an additional `useReducerWithEffect` hook added.
